// // 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

const magicians2: string[] = ["Cris Angel", "Deren Brown" , "Deren Brown"];

        magicians[i] =  ' The Great ' + magicians[i]
    }
