// i.Print your array in its origional order.
// console.log("Print array in origional order:")
// console.log(places)

// ii .Print your array in alphabatical order without modifing the actual list.
// console.log("In Alphabatical order:")
// places.sort()
// console.log(places)

// iii . Show that your array is still in its origional order by printing it.
// console.log("Still in origional order:")
// console.log(places)

// iv. Print your array in reverse alphabatical order without changing the order of the origional list.
// console.log("Now array in reverse Alphabatical order:")
// places.sort().reverse()
// console.log(places)

// v. Show that your array is still in its origional order by printing it again.
// console.log("Array still in its origional order:")
// console.log(places)

// vi. Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed.
// console.log("Reversed Order of array:")
// places.reverse()
// console.log(places)


// vii. Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it's back to its origional order.
// console.log("In origional order by revesing:")
// places.reverse().reverse()
// console.log(places)

// viii.  Sort your array so it's stored in alphabatical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.
// console.log("Array in alphabatical order:")
// places.sort()
// console.log(places)

// ix.  Sort to change your array so it's stored in reverse alphabaical order. Print the list to show that 
// // its order has changed.
// console.log("Array in reverse Alphabatical order:")
