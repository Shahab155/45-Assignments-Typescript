// // 35. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that 
// // have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, 
// // and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
// // Task 1: making list:
// let namesOfAnimals:string [] = ["Cat","Dog","Bafelo","Cow"]
// // Task 2: use for loop.
// console.log("Task 1:")
// for(let i=0; i<namesOfAnimals.length;i++){
//     console.log(`${namesOfAnimals[i] } `)}
// // • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such
// //  as A dog would make a great pet.
// console.log("Task 2:")
// for(let i=0;i<namesOfAnimals.length; i++){
//  console.log(`${namesOfAnimals[i]} would make great pet.` )
// }
// // • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 
// // You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
// console.log("Task 3:")
// console.log("These animals are pet, also they have a tail and four legs. ")
